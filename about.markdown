Hello! My name is Alan. I'm a second-year computer science major at Case Western Reserve University.

I'm still exploring various CS topics, but I have a growing interest in areas such as low-level programming, systems programming, and graphics programming.

Additionally, I plan on pursuing mathematics as either a minor or secondary major.
