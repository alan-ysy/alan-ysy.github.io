Making and maintaining a personal website is something I've wanted to do for a while now. It's kind of cool to have a link online where I can say, "Yeah, that's *my* website, everything on there is published by me."

I'm pretty happy with how this first iteration turned out! Sure, it's not the prettiest or the most functional. Right now it's literally just words on a page with the occasional link to bring you somewhere else. Regardless, I'm proud of it and excited to improve it over time!

## What This Site Is For

I want this site to primarily be a place where I can make blog posts about my interests, namely computer science. Throughout my life, I've been doing a *lot* of learning. I'm grateful for my education, but I've come to realize that I'm not so good at *creating*. So, I want to create more and put things out there. This blog will hopefully be one way I do that!

I think the posts I'll be making will be akin to journal entries. Short writings on specific topics I have thoughts on. They probably won't be super professional or groundbreaking, but I'm fine with keeping things lighthearted.

## How I Made This Site

I first created this site solely using HTML/CSS. The layout is extremely minimal, so I was able to create the whole site in a few days.

The next step I took was to migrate it to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This move was also quite easy, and I used the Jekyll [step-by-step tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) to learn how it works. Most of the work with migrating came with creating the layouts for the homepage and post pages.

That's basically it! All I had to do was set up a GitHub repo and publish the site through GitHub Pages. If you want to create a simple website, I quite enjoyed this method.

## Inspiration

[James' Coffee Blog](https://jamesg.blog/) was a HUGE inspiration for this site. I really liked his site layout with the two columns, one with the navigation bar, the other with the main page content. He has some great posts on how he [created](https://jamesg.blog/2021/05/28/how-i-built-this-website) and [designed](https://jamesg.blog/2024/08/16/content-layout-design) his site, and I would highly recommend checking them out. Additionally, if you inspect his site's source code, he has loads of lovely comments that explain how he did things, which is seriously amazing.

## Future Plans

Some future goals:

- Adjust margin/padding sizes for better readability
- Adjust colors and tweak overall aesthetics
- Add more accessibility features
- Create a system for organizing posts
- Create a script that automates creating a new post
- Add responsive web design functionality (e.g. resizing)
- Last but not least, write more!! :)
